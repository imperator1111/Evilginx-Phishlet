What is a Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a type of server that sits between clients (e.g., users accessing a website) and the backend servers (e.g., the actual website's server). Instead of clients directly interacting with the backend server, they connect to the reverse proxy, which forwards their requests and then relays responses back to them.

Key Functions of a Reverse Proxy:
Traffic Distribution: Distributes incoming traffic among multiple backend servers to ensure optimal performance and availability.
Load Balancing: Prevents overload on a single server by spreading requests.
Security Enhancement: Hides the backend server’s IP address, providing an additional layer of protection.
SSL Termination: Manages SSL encryption and decryption to reduce the backend server’s load.
Caching: Speeds up content delivery by caching frequently accessed content.
What is Evilginx?
Evilginx is an advanced reverse proxy tool designed for penetration testing and red team activities. It is particularly useful in testing web application security, especially in areas like authentication and session management.

Evilginx is primarily used to perform phishing attacks in a controlled environment. It allows attackers (or testers) to proxy traffic between a victim and a legitimate website, intercepting authentication tokens, session cookies, and other sensitive information.

Key Features:
Phishlets: Modular YAML configuration files that define how Evilginx proxies and interacts with specific websites.
Session Hijacking: Captures session tokens (cookies) to bypass login credentials and gain access to accounts.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass: Intercepts valid tokens to circumvent 2FA mechanisms like SMS codes or authenticator apps.
JavaScript Injection: Dynamically injects scripts into proxied pages to modify or capture additional data.
Evilpuppet Integration: Automates interactions with the website to bypass captchas or perform other actions.
What Can You Obtain with Evilginx?
Cookies (Session Hijacking)

Evilginx captures the victim's session cookies when they log in through the proxy.
What is a session cookie?

A session cookie is a piece of data that identifies the user to a website after they log in. It eliminates the need for repeated authentication for subsequent requests.
Why is it valuable?

If you have a victim's session cookie, you can impersonate them without knowing their password or 2FA code.
Bypass Credentials (Phishing)

How it works: The victim is tricked into entering their username and password on a page served by Evilginx. The tool forwards these credentials to the real website and captures them in transit.
Impact: An attacker can log in to the victim's account even without their session cookie.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass

Why 2FA is not foolproof: Even if the victim has 2FA enabled (e.g., SMS or authenticator app codes), Evilginx can capture the session token after the victim completes the 2FA process.
Since session cookies represent a logged-in state, the attacker does not need the 2FA code anymore.
Behavioral Insights (Traffic Analysis)

Evilginx can intercept additional data during the victim's interaction with the proxied website, such as:
User behavior (e.g., mouse movements, form submissions).
Browser and device information.
How Does Evilginx Work?
Setup:

Evilginx is deployed on a server with a domain configured to act as a reverse proxy.
A Phishlet is set up for the target website (e.g., "example.com").
Victim Interaction:

The victim receives a phishing link (e.g., "fake-login.example.com") crafted to look like the real website.
They enter their credentials and, if required, complete 2FA.
Session Interception:

Evilginx forwards the victim's login data to the legitimate website, allowing them to log in as usual.
Simultaneously, Evilginx captures the session cookie and any other relevant authentication tokens.
Access Granted:

Using the captured cookie, the attacker gains full access to the victim's account without needing a password or 2FA code.
Payment and Guarantee Terms
All sales are made on a guarantor basis. The project will be tested on the client's server before any payment is made. Once testing is successfully completed and the client is satisfied, the payment will be processed.

We can create Phishlets for any site you want, not just the ones we currently offer.
